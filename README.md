# Chingu Solo Project - Tier 3 - Critical Space Strike Game



# -WARNING- Before you take on this project, know that the frame rates, and animation process can produce effects similar to strobe lights, if you have any # # #sensitivity to these things, especially with seizures proceed with extreme caution. 
Also be aware of producing a strobe lighting effect as you create it, even if you are unaffected, this may hurt someone who plays your game. Strobe light effects should not be used in any way. Small bits of image flash are very common in animating, just be aware of bright lighting(coloring) that can simulate a flash during the process.
